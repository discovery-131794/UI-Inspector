# UI-Inspector

UI-Inspector is a GUI tool that can be used to view the whole desktop UI tree and property of every node.
For python developers who use uiautomation and pyjab to develop, UI-Inspector can generate tree structure and corresponding code for specified UI element.
Now, UI-Inspector supports most windows desktop applications which implemented uiautomation framework and java applications. In the future, I will try to add XML document support and maybe itegrate selenium to it.
